# The journey of a thousand miles...
## ..........begins with agonizing over which shoes will be the most comfortable.

**Of** the initial learning projects I [listed](https://zenacity.org/Projects/RHCE/RHCE - Getting Started.html), all but the Samba share is finished. I did two blog posts of seven I had planned, which isn't terrible. The internet pretty much has Apache and virtual hosts covered in more detail than I care to go into. The Samba share I will work on today hopefully, if the internet ever comes back on (big storm last night).

## Have I become more confident in my skill level?

Yes and no. This is not unexpected. When you are learning anything, you frequently bounce between "I am the second coming of Dennis Ritchie" and "Please just cat me into /dev/null." The important part is to keep going, keep evaluating your goals, **without** making your abilities a definition of your self-worth. Easier said than done? Maybe.

## Other Accomplishments

- Set up Network Bond on home server between two NICs
- Created an rpm package for a mediawiki extension
  - Submitted package for review to be an official Fedora Package for the Infrastructure team
- Closed/fixed a couple of Fedora Infrastructure tickets

## Whats up next?
