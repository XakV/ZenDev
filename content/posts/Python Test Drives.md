### Test Driven Development - **YAWN** - AMIRIGHT?

Well, no, I'm not all. It's too soon for me to be all-in-fanboy-bought-the-season-tickets, however, I wouldn't be surprised if I was trying TDD out as a dog-training model soon. It's late, so, I'll just say this, TDD seems like a good way to bridge the gap from "I can slice strings in at least three different ways!" to actually being able to carve out code from an idea. 

What's the biggest pain in learning to code for you? For me, it's a toss-up. I go through phases like, "I've done the tutorial, what now?", and "I could do a complicated thing, but this language is just not made for it.", and probably other excuses. TDD says, "Hey take one idea out of a bunch, fail at that, then write some code to fix it, now make it look nice." 

Note, this is a major over-simplification....

The idea though is to work on small bits, a thing that solves one problem, then go on to the next thing. Put a few things together, revise, make sure it still works, and repeat. For someone that doesn't have a ton of programming experience, the bigger value is in the chunking of work. It's a framework for breaking big problems into smaller problems, and at the same time, you are able to keep track of the big picture. Moreover, failure is not only an option, it's step one.
